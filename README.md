SQL Basic Data Querying Project 

This is my 1st SQL project for the SQL Crash Course prvided by CoRise(https://corise.com/course/sql-crash-course), where I explore the basic queries of SQL by creating and manipulating custom tables.

This project was based on the SQL Crash course available in CoRise website:https://corise.com/course/sql-crash-course.

Introduction:
As the General manager for the Sydney area at Airbnb, you want to know more about the different listings of houses your team has onboarded. You have access to information regarding the listings, neighbourhoods, reviews, and calendar. Each of these have their own separate table.
